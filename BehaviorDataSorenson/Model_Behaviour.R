###################### Model estimates - behavioural data ######################
# Modelling on behaviours marked by PS with at least 'good agreement' between all 
# coders in the IRR analysis: 
# (1) Looking towards their partner
# (2) Visiting the other half of the lagoon 
# (3) Swimming together
