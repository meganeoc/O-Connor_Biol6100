YAY GRAPHS!
Using the airquality dataset from R, that has info about air quality measurements in New York City.
```
ggplot template (for my brain)

p1 <- ggplot(data= <DATA>) +
      aes(<MAPPINGS>) + 
      <GEOM_FUNCTION>(aes(<MAPPINGS>),
                      stat=<STAT>,
                      position=<POSITION>) +
                      <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
                      <FACET_FUNCTION>
```
```{r}
# loading things area
library(ggplot2)
library(beeswarm)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(RColorBrewer)
data(airquality)
head(airquality)


```

Beeswarm Plot! bzzzzzzzzz
```{r}
# had a lot of trouble since month is technically a numeric value, but here is how to turn it into a factor
airquality$Month <- factor(airquality$Month)

ggplot(airquality,aes(x=Month, y=Wind, color=Month)) +
  geom_beeswarm()+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("olivedrab3","gold","orange2","red1","darkred"))+
  ggtitle("Windspeed Variation in New York City Based on Month")

```
Making a plot with some of my very initial data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("NLPsheet2.csv")
ggplot(data=data,aes(x=Date, y=Total_NLPs)) +
  geom_beeswarm()
```
I think this is kinda the wrong graph type for this data right now though!

Bar Plot of NLPs
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Behavior, y = Total_NLPs, fill = Behavior)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ffffcc", "#a1dab4", "#41b6c4","#2c7fb8", "#225ea8")) +
  ggtitle("Presence of NLPs Dependent on Dolphin Behavior")
```
